## About

Mamba is a new state space model architecture showing promising performance on information-dense data such as language modeling, where previous subquadratic models fall short of Transformers.
It is based on the line of progress on [structured state space models](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4),
with an efficient hardware-aware design and implementation in the spirit of [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).

## Installation

No needed

## Usage

We expose several levels of interface with the Mamba model.

### Selective SSM

Mamba is based on a selective SSM layer, which is the focus of the paper (Section 3; Algorithm 2).

Source: [ops/selective_scan_interface.py](mamba_ssm/ops/selective_scan_interface.py).

### Mamba Block

The main module of this repository is the Mamba architecture block wrapping the selective SSM.

Source: [modules/mamba_simple.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py).

Usage:
```
from mamba_ssm import Mamba

batch, length, dim = 2, 64, 16
x = torch.randn(batch, length, dim).to("cuda")
model = Mamba(
    # This module uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters
    d_model=dim, # Model dimension d_model
    d_state=16,  # SSM state expansion factor
    d_conv=4,    # Local convolution width
    expand=2,    # Block expansion factor
).to("cuda")
y = model(x)
assert y.shape == x.shape
```

### Mamba Language Model

Finally, we provide an example of a complete language model: a deep sequence model backbone (with repeating Mamba blocks) + language model head.

Source: [models/mixer_seq_simple.py](mamba_ssm/models/mixer_seq_simple.py).

This is an example of how to integrate Mamba into an end-to-end neural network.
This example is used in the generation scripts below.



## Pretrained Models

Pretrained models are uploaded to
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/state-spaces): `mamba-130m`, `mamba-370m`,
`mamba-790m`, `mamba-1.4b`, `mamba-2.8b`, trained on 300B tokens on the Pile, as well as `mamba-2.8b-slimpj`
(trained on 600B tokens on the SlimPajama dataset).


The models will be autodownloaded by the generation script below.

These models were trained on the [Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/pile), and follow the standard model dimensions described by GPT-3 and followed by many open source models:

| Parameters | Layers | Model dim. | 
|------------|--------|------------|
| 130M       | 24     | 768        |
| 370M       | 48     | 1024       |
| 790M       | 48     | 1536       |
| 1.4B       | 48     | 2048       |
| 2.8B       | 64     | 2560       |

(The layer count of Mamba doubles that of a Transformer with similar size, as two Mamba blocks are needed for each "layer" (MHA block + MLP block) of a Transformer.)

Note: these are base models trained only for 300B tokens, without any form of downstream modification (instruction tuning, etc.).
Performance is expected to be comparable or better than other architectures trained on similar data, but not to match larger or fine-tuned models.

## Inference

The script [mamba_generate.py](mamba_generate.py)
1. autoloads a model from the Hugging Face Hub,
2. generates completions of a user-specified prompt,
3. measures the inference speed of this generation.

Other configurable options include the top-p (nucleus sampling) probability, and the softmax temperature.

### Example

```
python mamba_generate.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
python mamba_generate.py --model-name "EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
```


## Troubleshooting

### Precision
Our models were trained using PyTorch [AMP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html) for mixed precision. AMP keeps model parameters in float32 and casts to half precision when necessary.
On the other hand, other frameworks like DeepSpeed store parameters in float16 and upcasts when necessary (e.g. for optimizer accumulation).

We've observed that higher precision for the main model parameters may be necessary, because SSMs are sensitive to their recurrent dynamics. If you are experiencing instabilities,
as a first step please try a framework storing parameters in fp32 (such as AMP).

### Initialization
Some parts of the model have initializations inherited from prior work on S4 models.
For [example](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L102), the $\Delta$ parameter has a targeted range by initializing the bias of its linear projection.
However, some frameworks may have post-initialization hooks (e.g. setting all bias terms in `nn.Linear` modules to zero).
If this is the case, you may have to add custom logic (e.g. this [line](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L104) turns off re-initializing in our trainer, but would be a no-op in any other framework)
that is specific to the training framework.
